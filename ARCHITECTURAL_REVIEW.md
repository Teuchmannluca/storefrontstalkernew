# Amazon Storefront Tracker - Architectural Review

## Executive Summary

The Amazon Storefront Tracker is a sophisticated arbitrage analysis platform built with Next.js 15, Supabase, and extensive Amazon SP-API integration. The architecture demonstrates good separation of concerns, appropriate technology choices, and reasonable adherence to SOLID principles, though there are areas for improvement particularly in error handling, rate limiting implementation, and architectural consistency.

**Architectural Impact Assessment: Medium**

## 1. Overall System Architecture & Design Patterns

### Strengths
- **Clean separation between client and server code** using Next.js App Router
- **Modular API route structure** with clear boundaries
- **Service-oriented architecture** for external API integrations
- **Streaming architecture** for long-running operations (SSE)
- **Context-based state management** for cross-component communication

### Concerns
- **Inconsistent service abstraction** - some API routes directly implement business logic rather than delegating to service layers
- **Mixed responsibilities** in some API routes (e.g., authentication, validation, and business logic)
- **Limited use of design patterns** like Repository or Unit of Work for data access

## 2. Technology Stack & Component Organization

### Technology Choices (Appropriate)
- **Next.js 15.4.5** - Excellent choice for SSR and API routes
- **Supabase** - Good fit for authentication and PostgreSQL with RLS
- **TypeScript** - Provides type safety across the codebase
- **Tailwind CSS** - Efficient styling approach
- **Playwright** - Comprehensive E2E testing

### Component Organization
```
src/
├── app/                    # Next.js App Router pages and API routes
│   ├── api/               # API endpoints (well-organized)
│   └── dashboard/         # Dashboard pages
├── components/            # React components (good separation)
├── contexts/              # React contexts (proper pattern)
├── hooks/                 # Custom hooks
└── lib/                   # Business logic and utilities
```

**Issue**: Some business logic is scattered between API routes and lib files, lacking a consistent service layer pattern.

## 3. API Structure & Data Flow

### API Organization (Good)
- Clear RESTful-style endpoints
- Logical grouping by domain (arbitrage, catalog, fees, pricing, storefronts)
- Consistent route naming conventions

### Data Flow Analysis
1. **Client → API Route → Service → External API → Database → Response**
2. **Streaming Pattern**: Client → SSE Stream → Progressive Updates

### Architectural Concerns
- **No API versioning strategy**
- **Inconsistent error handling** across endpoints
- **Missing request/response validation layer**
- **No centralized logging or monitoring hooks**

## 4. Database Schema & Relationships

### Schema Design (Well-structured)
```sql
storefronts (1) → (N) products
arbitrage_scans (1) → (N) arbitrage_opportunities
```

### Strengths
- **Proper foreign key constraints**
- **Efficient indexes** on commonly queried fields
- **UUID primary keys** for distributed systems compatibility
- **JSONB for flexible data** (sales_ranks, metadata)

### Concerns
- **No explicit versioning** for schema migrations
- **Missing audit columns** (created_by, updated_by)
- **No soft delete pattern** implemented

## 5. Authentication & Authorization

### Current Implementation
- **Supabase Auth** with JWT tokens
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies for data isolation
- **Service role key** for server-side operations

### Security Concerns
- **Middleware is placeholder** - no server-side auth validation
- **API routes manually check auth** - should be centralized
- **No rate limiting per user** - only per API endpoint
- **Missing API key rotation strategy**

## 6. Rate Limiting & External API Integration

### Rate Limiting Implementation
```typescript
// Token bucket implementation in sp-api-rate-limiter.ts
export class SPAPIRateLimiter {
  private tokens: number;
  private maxTokens: number;
  private refillRate: number;
  // ...
}
```

### Strengths
- **Token bucket algorithm** - efficient and accurate
- **Per-API endpoint limits** - respects Amazon's constraints
- **Automatic retry with backoff**

### Architectural Issues
- **Singleton pattern** - limits scalability in distributed systems
- **In-memory state** - lost on restart, not shared across instances
- **No circuit breaker pattern** for failing APIs
- **Hard-coded delays** instead of adaptive rate limiting

## 7. SOLID Principles Analysis

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - Partially Violated
- API routes often handle multiple concerns (auth, validation, business logic)
- Example: `/api/arbitrage/analyze-stream/route.ts` - 743 lines handling everything

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP) - Good Adherence
- Service classes are extensible
- New marketplaces can be added without modifying core logic

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - Good Adherence
- Consistent interfaces for SP-API clients
- Proper inheritance where used

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - Needs Improvement
- Large interfaces in some service classes
- Could benefit from more granular interfaces

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - Partially Violated
- Direct instantiation of services in API routes
- No dependency injection container

## 8. Architectural Concerns & Recommendations

### Critical Issues

1. **Error Handling Architecture**
   - No global error handler
   - Inconsistent error responses
   - **Recommendation**: Implement error boundary pattern and standardized error responses

2. **State Management for Rate Limiting**
   - In-memory state won't scale
   - **Recommendation**: Use Redis for distributed rate limiting

3. **Business Logic Distribution**
   - Logic scattered between API routes and lib files
   - **Recommendation**: Implement proper service layer pattern

4. **Missing Architectural Patterns**
   - No Repository pattern for data access
   - No Command/Query separation (CQRS)
   - **Recommendation**: Consider implementing Repository pattern for data access

### Performance Concerns

1. **N+1 Query Problems**
   - Some routes fetch data in loops
   - **Recommendation**: Implement batch fetching and query optimization

2. **Large Streaming Responses**
   - No pagination for large datasets
   - **Recommendation**: Implement cursor-based pagination

3. **Cold Start Issues**
   - Heavy initialization in some routes
   - **Recommendation**: Lazy load heavy dependencies

### Scalability Limitations

1. **Stateful Rate Limiting**
   - Won't work in serverless/edge environments
   - **Recommendation**: External state management (Redis/DynamoDB)

2. **No Caching Strategy**
   - Repeated API calls for same data
   - **Recommendation**: Implement caching layer (Redis/CDN)

3. **Synchronous Processing**
   - Long-running operations block resources
   - **Recommendation**: Queue-based architecture for heavy processing

## 9. Positive Architectural Decisions

1. **Streaming Architecture**: Excellent use of SSE for real-time updates
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage
3. **Modular Structure**: Clear separation of concerns in most areas
4. **Database Design**: Well-thought-out schema with proper constraints
5. **External API Abstraction**: Good encapsulation of Amazon SP-API complexity

## 10. Recommended Refactoring Priority

### High Priority
1. Implement proper service layer pattern
2. Add centralized error handling
3. Move rate limiting to external state store
4. Add request validation middleware

### Medium Priority
1. Implement Repository pattern for data access
2. Add comprehensive logging architecture
3. Implement circuit breaker for external APIs
4. Add API versioning strategy

### Low Priority
1. Consider CQRS for complex queries
2. Add event sourcing for audit trail
3. Implement feature flags system
4. Add comprehensive monitoring

## Conclusion

The Amazon Storefront Tracker demonstrates solid foundational architecture with good technology choices and reasonable organization. However, it exhibits common issues in rapidly developed applications: inconsistent abstraction levels, scattered business logic, and scalability limitations in state management.

The most critical improvements needed are:
1. **Consistent service layer implementation**
2. **Distributed state management for rate limiting**
3. **Centralized error handling and validation**
4. **Better separation of concerns in API routes**

With these improvements, the application would be well-positioned for scale and maintainability while preserving its current strengths in streaming architecture and type safety.
